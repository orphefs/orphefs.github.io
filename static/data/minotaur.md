# Minotaur-R

At [iKnowHow](https://www.iknowhow.com/), I was the lead computer vision engineer for the Minotaur-R project, where I designed an algorithm for detecting irradiated springs in order for them to be removed (using a robot) from a pile of nuclear debris. You can read my article on [Medium](https://orphefs.medium.com/detecting-and-sorting-nuclear-waste-using-deep-convolutional-neural-networks-3ada9b402363), where I describe all stages including model training, inference, as well as post-processing steps, in order to calculate spring occlusion level and orientation (for improving the robotic grasping ability). Achievements:

- **Led a team** of 2 software engineers and 1 robotics engineer,
- Trained **segmentation** deep learning algorithms using Python,
- Used code versioning and software engineering best practices
- Achieved picking accuracy of 95%.
