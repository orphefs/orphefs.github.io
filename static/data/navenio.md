# Location-based services

At [Navenio LTD](https://navenio.com/), in Oxford, I was member of the core research team, where I developed an component for distinguishing the floor on which a smartphone user is located, based on the WiFi fingerprint of their device. This involved the use of **unsupervised learning** and **signal processing** techniques, performing ETL and analyzing large datasets with numerical and textual data, and extensive test coverage. Achievements:

- Prototyped and productionized ETL pipeline and ML pipeline to derive indoor locations of smartphone users based on inertial and WiFi data.
- Helped achieve mean indoor localization accuracy of 5 m using WiFi fingerprinting.
- First-authored one [patent](https://patents.google.com/patent/WO2020089593A1/) on the technology I developed.
