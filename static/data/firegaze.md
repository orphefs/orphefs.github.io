# firegaze.ai: Crowdsourced wildfire detection for disaster prevention

I am very passionate about taking part in reversing climate change - Forest fires are devastating and as a resident of Greece, I have experienced this first hand. According to Project Drawdown forest management and preservation is one of the top ways to tackle climate change. I have always been an active environmentalist, which included taking part in community reforestation activities, but I wanted to be part of something bigger and scalable, and at the same time put my technical skills to work.

For that reason, I started developing a forest smoke detection app I named [firegaze-ai](https://github.com/firegaze-ai). I am currently working on decreasing false negative rates, which is proving quite challenging, due to instances where clouds can be mistaken with smoke. I am also developing the backend (using FastAPI and serverless architecture) system, as well as the smartphone app (React Native) directed at the end user. My aim is to open-source the technology so that people living at the boundaries of civilization (i.e. forest fringes) can benefit at minimal cost.
